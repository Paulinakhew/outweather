# OutWeather
OutWeather is a web application that helps users determine what to wear and what accessories to bring with them when they go outside. 

## Purpose
Through this application, we hope to advise users of the weather conditions and suggest an ideal outfit so that they are prepared for the weather conditions. We designed a clean and simple UI to make it easy to use. Users can enter their location, and the app will then proceed to display details on the weather, as well as a possible outfit to wear from top to bottom. 

## How to run
1. Run the app locally by typing in `python3 controller.py` into your terminal. Paste `http://127.0.0.1:5000/mainmenu` into your browser which will bring you to the home page.
2. Click the "Get Started" button.
3. Enter your location (city) on the second page and press "Send". 
4. Check out your outfit on the third page. If you want a new outfit, simply refresh the page. 
5. Wear the outfit, look super fly, and stay warm ðŸ˜Ž

### Our Team
[Paulina Khew](https://github.com/Paulinakhew), [Daniel Kim](https://github.com/dannyhkim), and [Ahmad Chaudhry](https://github.com/ahmadtc1) created this project while participating at Hack the Valley. Paulina created the flask app, Ahmad worked with the API from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api), and Daniel was in charge of the UI/UX. We all worked on the HTML/CSS as well as the python portion of the code. 

### What is Hack the Valley?
Hack the Valley is a 36 hour hackathon at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus.Check out their website at https://hackthevalley.io/. 

### Design
Everything on this app was designed from scratch by [@dannyhkim](https://github.com/dannyhkim). He created the logo using Illustrator and then created a PDF of what the app was supposed to look like using Figma. Our team then used HTML and CSS to make his vision come to life! 

#### The future of this app
Although we have created a basic functioning app of our idea, there are many things we can build upon to improve the UX. We hope to expand on the different types of clothing suggested, and give different outfits for men and women. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open up a GitHub issue for us! :heart:
